the ultimate in nutritional support is supplements designed using your personal dna assessment. and it's affordable. you can get information about your dna! did you inherit your father or mother's genetic history? or maybe not! it's now available.  3/21/2012 last night i took my first argentine tango lesson! jacqueline is this wonderful dancing buddah that teaches dance fusion at the pac. i took to her style of dance immediately. she mixes salsa, cha cha, and tango into the hour of dance, and i love it! just what the dr. ordered! thank you markus and dr. r. for bugging me! i have been reminded twice now, that dancing free style - like modern dance, unstructured would build some fire for me. i have been keeping dance fusion on my calendar for months now, trying to get it into my routine. i am slow to start something new, but once i make the commitment, i put more attention on it until it's integrated into my life. jacqueline has been an amazing match to what i have been looking for, and i found her with little effort! yay! so, this is what i learned about myself: hopefully, you can take some of this away for yourself.  i learned that tango requires of me to be present. i have to be in the moment. i have to focus on staying in my circle, keeping my attention between me and my dance partner. don't look down. don't think!!! don't think!!! don't think! i noticed that my feet were doing what they were suppose to be doing, as long as i stepped with the music, and kept walking. keep my frame centered face to face with my partner. as long as i was in the moment, and continued to stay with my partner and be present, i was ok. it was a strange feeling to be ""thoughtless""  what i was doing, when i tried to think, was ""chase"" my partner. i was slightly delayed. how many times do i ""chase"" my goals?  today, i forgot to come to work for one of my most favorite clients. my daughter mckenna stayed home in the morning because she has had a tummy ache for days. she just needed to sleep in a bit longer. i lost track of my routine after that. my favorite auntie (80+ years old) was visiting my mom for lunch and we both decided to meet her. it was a beautiful gathering, full of joy and laughter, and a beautiful sunny day! then we took a walk to the dance store to replace mckenna's shoes.  i had this feeling that i needed to be at the shop! i kept thinking i have to be there, but i didn't even try to check my calendar! so, we went home. and, i got a phone call from my favorite client! i missed my appointment with her. she's forgiven me, and we're rescheduling for tomorrow, but, i still am upset with myself! right now, i am mentally punishing myself for not being aware! i was chasing something else. i was in the moment enjoying my auntie and my family, and i could have been on time for my client! but, i didn't use my calendar to check my own schedule. i'm irritated with myself that i didn't listen to my inner guidance! how silly of me to have a calendar if i don't use it! everything that doesn't allow me to use my tools that i make to keep myself organized, let me destroy and uncreate that! rwgbppansbb!!!  3/21/2012 had my first argentine dance class last night! i learn more about myself when i take a class like that. how much am i able to be in present time? that's what it's all about in dance. that's what is all about in just about anything isn't it? i find it in my quilting, golf, yoga, just about anything really. being present is most valuable when being intimate with the one you love. ahh, what a sweet thought isn't it? i learned that i can easily let myself start thinking, which is the one thing you don't want to do with the argentine dance. you and your partner have to be in sync with the music. it's romantic, passionate, present! wow!! i am ready for more! did you happen to watch dancing with the stars monday night! it's going to be a good season! let me know if you are watching it too!  3/12/2012 well, i am dancing now! i found this awesome dance class called dance fusion and jaqueline is this amazing and sexy dancer who's inspiring me to get my groove back! i've been taking pilates for a year and a half and my core is strong, but i was missing music in my life. yay! i am happy to fit this new hobby into my already full and active life! until i find my life-mate play-mate, i'll be keeping myself busy and happy doing fun things. how does it get better than this?
