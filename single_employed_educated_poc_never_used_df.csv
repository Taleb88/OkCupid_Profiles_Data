""why is he in a suit?"" i make it a point to dress nicely in social occasions, when i can afford to. i am keenly aware that i'm not entirely pleasant to look at, so the least i can do is make the effort to dress nicer than i look. also, i dislike wearing denim, and you will never find me in a pair of jeans.  ""holy crap what's wrong with your fingers."" only slightly exaggerated, but my fingers do draw some degree of attention. there is hair growing on the first set of metacarpals beyond the knuckles, and this seems to shock people when they notice them. i am... actually somewhat embarrassed by this fact, but i make no effort to shave my fingers.","i'll admit, i'm not a very literary person. the words ""have you read?"" are lost on me more often than not. i've read more comics than actual novels, but there are a scant few that i've actually enjoyed. i'll list them below in no particular order.  tales from underground (dostoyevsky) hellsing (manga, kouta hirano) the book of five rings (musashi) sin city (comic, frank miller)  i don't watch a lot of tv, and in the rare cases that i do, my favorite shows are usually cancelled.  better off ted (cancelled) big bang theory how i met your mother firefly ('nuff said) breaking in (cancelled, then uncancelled?) wonderfalls (cancelled)  i do watch quite a bit of anime, although i only choose to separate them from the tv segment because i can't actually watch them broadcast on tv. this is in no particular order:  queen's blade (seasons 1 & 2, ovas and rebellion) black rock shooter (2012 anime) steins;gate baccano! strike witches hellsing ultimate (ova) trigun the slayers sayonara zetsubou sensei (any and all of them, i can't keep track anymore) fate/stay night high school of the dead the idolm@ster last exile (still haven't seen the new series, looking to find it) panty & stocking with garterbelt tengen toppa gurren lagann nichijou persona 4: the animation carnival phantasm (ova)  i'm not particularly big on movies either, but i do watch quite a bit and i have a few eclectic favorites.  akira (anime, film) steamboy (anime, film) summer wars (anime, film) ghost in the shell 1 & 2 (anime, film) millennium actress (anime, film) fearless (jet li) fong sai yuk series (jet li, hong kong) once upon a time in china series (jet li, hong kong) samurai fiction (japanese) scott pilgrim vs the world  i've been somewhat disconnected from mainstream music, for various reasons. i usually enjoy soundtracks from my favorite games or anime, but i also enjoy classic rock. here's another completely scrambled list of my favorite bands and composers:  shoji meguro (shin megami tensei series, persona series) daisuke ishiwatari (guilty gear series, blazblue series) zun (touhou series) crow's claw (indie circle, japan) demetori (indie circle, japan) queen ac/dc van halen  food... oh boy. i don't have any particular favorites, but i do enjoy just about everything with rare few exceptions. if i had to pick out favorites, i'd have to go with the rich, succulent flavor of gourmet seafood, or the powerful, filling flavor of good barbecue.  and because video games are a large part of my hobbies, here's a rough list of my favorites below:  league of legends (pc, strategy) skullgirls (multi, 2d fighting game) blazblue series (ps3/360, 2d fighting) soul calibur series (multi, 3d fighting) street fighter x tekken (ps3/360, 2d fighting) dead or alive series (multi, 3d fighting) arcana heart series (ps2-ps3, 2d fighting) king of fighters series (multi, 2d fighting) darkstalkers series (multi, 2d fighting) rival schools series (multi, 3d fighting) tales of vesperia (360, jrpg) nier (ps3/360, action jrpg) shin megami tensei: nocturne (ps2, jrpg) persona 3: fes (ps2, jrpg) persona 4 (ps2, jrpg) catherine (ps3/360, puzzle horror rpg) .hack series (ps2, jrpg) final fantasy tactics (ps1/psp, tactical jrpg) disgaea series (ps2-ps3, tactical jrpg) sengoku basara: samurai heroes (ps3, action adventure) devil may cry series (ps2-ps3, action adventure) bayonetta (ps3/360, action adventure) saint's row: the third (multi, action shooter) touhou series (pc, danmaku shooter) monster hunter series (multi, action) team fortress 2 (pc, fps, and likely the only fps on this list) portal series (multi, first-person puzzle) diablo iii (pc, adventure-rpg) katawa shoujo (pc, visual novel) dc universe online (pc, action-mmo) phantasy star online (dreamcast, action-mmo)","music silence disturbs me. music moves me. the absence of motion is unsettling.  fiction i'd normally single out 'anime' or 'games', but the truth is i just want to have some fiction to fall into. it doesn't have to be a grand sweeping epic, it can be simple and fun; it doesn't matter, as long as there's something to experience and explore.  companionship i don't consider myself extroverted, nor do i consider myself introverted. all the same, being all alone is a frightening, frightening thought. i often get depressed when there's absolutely no one in the house except myself.  art this might file under the 'fiction' section, but it has more to do with my own ability to create art rather than to experience it. as mentioned above, i love to create. it comes together with the other entries above: i love to absorb fiction, coalesce them into thought, create art, and share my creations with people.  humor i don't consider myself a dreadfully serious person. i love to laugh, because... well, who doesn't?  erotica it's worth mentioning a second time that i am notoriously perverted. i'm proud of my sexuality and make no secret of it. call me shallow if you must, but i idolize beauty and i don't hold myself back with some false sense of 'maturity'. if i think it's sexy, i'll call it as i see it.","no eloquent paragraphs this time, my thoughts aren't so clear-cut to me that i can write essays about them.  much of my head is buried in games and fiction. if i'm not pondering story ideas or ludicrously sexy character designs, i'm probably thinking about game design, or some way to merge the two into a cohesive narrative experience. a lot of time is spent thinking about how to bridge the gap between western game design tropes and eastern game design tropes to make one multicultural awesome mega-game. the few times i'm not thinking of games or stories, i'm probably thinking about the future, which isn't always a positive experience. if nothing else, i also spend time thinking of how to make more money, or of my next self-appointed project, assuming i'm not already on one.","drawing or gaming. the two activities comprise most of my daily life, so this isn't really exclusive to friday nights.","back in high school, i used to drape my hair over one eye. i wasn't emo or anything, i just wanted to have cool anime hair. then emo people stole it from me, so i had to resort to more reasonable hair. as a result, my left eye is actually more nearsighted than my right eye. no joke, it's on my prescription.  fun fact: you actually can see through a curtain of hair over your eyes. the hair is close enough such that you can see between the strands.","you can tolerate frequent rants on western gaming culture vs eastern gaming culture, liberal distortion of the english language, or know what fratmog's means (or if you don't, be willing to learn!).  hell, message me anyway. i'm sure i've got something gentlemanly and/or strange to say in reply!"

and i often steal them from friends when we're out dancing. i'm not disgusted by smokers, but i don't like kissing smokers because it either tastes cigarettes or mint ... and it's not what i'm after when i kiss. i enjoy drinking alcohol with others but never alone. i rarely get drunk, except when i have reasons to forget something. i've never smoked marijuana, never taken hard drugs. i'm not against any, but i'm fearful of how i would react. i also don't like the smell of marijuana, but maybe if i'd smoke it, i would say differently. so, my position is that i'm not against the use of drugs, but i'm a little reluctant to try them myself. i also would mind dating an addicted guy.  politics - in france, i lean strongly to the left wing, and i agree with some ideas of the extreme left. the us equivalent is marginal (almost non-existent), so in that dichotomized system, i'd probably lean for the democrats. anyway, to make things clearer: if you are for the death penalty, against women rights (including abortion), for the freedom to bear arms, against social help ... we probably won't get along. but feel free to contact me if you'd like to argue about it :)  oh, shit, did it say summary at the top?!","if the question relates to my work, i'd say that some days i'm a statistical geneticist, some days i'm a genetic epidemiologist, most days i can't really define myself ... maybe just a scientist.  but to answer this question at its first level (what i'm doing with my life), i'd say that i'm trying to enjoy living it, while sharing it with my fellow humans and respecting our planet, its fauna, and flora.  i said i try, sometimes i fail.","using ... ellipses, memorizing things, forgetting other things, analyzing situations and understanding the feelings of others, intuitively knowing if something might work or not, cooking with or without a recipe, learning new things, reading and improving others writings, massage and cuddling.","my green eyes or my smile, but neither should be good enough reasons to ask me out. in fact, if it's the reason, you probably shouldn't.","my all times favorite book is 100 years of solitude by garcia marquez. other authors i like include adam, benacquista, camus, duras, gary/ajar, gaud, gide, gibran, maalouf, or vian. obviously i'm slightly biased toward french or lebanese authors.  my all time favorite film is less obvious to name. i'd say ex aequo l'amant, tacones lejanos (high heels), and et maintenant o on va? (where do we go now?). i've liked most of the work of almodovar (la mala educacion, todo sobre mi madre, habla con ella, la piel que habito), nadine labaki (a wonderful lebanese director), deepa mehta (water, earth, and fire), some of kubrick's work (2001: a space odyssey, clockwork orange), some israeli directors like eytan fox (yossi and jagger, walk on water, the bubble) or ronit elkabetz (take a wife, 7 days) or various other films like midnight cowboy, gerry, requiem for a dream, rain man, the reader, the piano lesson, the syrian bride, mother, the diving bell and the butterfly, wild reeds.  right now (mar 2012), i have a big thing for florence + the machine and indian music, but generally i have a constant attraction toward classical music, bach in particular. i also like to listen to foreign pop music like turkish (tarkan, beng, hande yener), israeli (ivri lider, ofra haza) or spanish ( luz casal, la oreja de van gogh). i've also had my periods of intensive listening (they often come back) of sufjan stevens, massive attack, rufus wainwright, (the ultra-lovely) pierre lapointe, depeche mode, archive, belle and sebastian, thievery corporation, morcheeba, coldplay, bjork, craig armstrong, alex beaupain, arvo part, the pet shop boys, cindy lauper, gotan project, etienne daho, the cranberries, iannis xenakis, neil hannon, brigitte fontaine, or adele.  i eat mostly anything (apart from raw oysters) and i love cooking and having meals with friends. ingredients that i appreciate most include eggplants, tomatoes, beans, cheeses, nuts, chocolate, wine, beer, tea, garlic, all sorts of spices ... i don't know what's going on in the bay area but everyone seems to be vegan here. i'm french and it is incompatible with vegetarianism. but to reassure you, i'm very open minded and i'm veg-friendly.","human relationships, freedom, memories, future perspectives, glasses, and books.","- my life and its meaning. - these days, what to do next. - to what extent do animals have thought processes, and how similar/different are they from us. - how would another species, studying us, describe us: as dolphins, sharks, or goldfish? - what is happiness? what factors influence it?","i don't really know what a typical friday night is, so i'll try to write here every week what i did on the friday night. - got drunk with friends but managed to come back home taking the bus.

(don't take it personally).  oh yeah, no jealous women please, as i'm not either (gees, i can be a swinger).  if you're interested, a little bit about me: i'm a 6' tall, 195lbs. asian who's ridiculously good looking with an exceptional personality (don't challenge me now! lol!).","if i were to break up my life, i say it's 1/3 work, 1/3 fun, and 1/3 everything else.  all 3 falls under the category of play!",being non-judgmental about humans being a sexual being and seeing people as individuals rather than as a group.,"i don't know. i'm not a mind reader, so why try to guess?","favorite book: anything by ron paul, murry rothbard and ludwig mises; and radical honesty",caffeine... my motorcycle... my computer... a shower at night... sleep... up-front honesty,reading the future based on geopolitics and austrian economics,"my work schedule is pretty hectic, so i don't really have a ""typical friday night."" in general, i like to read about economics, politics, and history during my free time.","that i'm willing to admit to a woman i'm with about anything in person. i don't like hide things. if you don't believe me, ask me a question you'd think i'd like to lie about.","if you read my profile and you're looking for the same thing i am.  also, do not write me unless you're serious about meeting up."

(june '13) i am no longer responding to one-liner messages. if you've sent me one of those and haven't gotten a response, that's probably why. so send me another message. cm' on, one-liners are kinda lame.  i like: being tall, open minded and free spirited people, bubble wrap, foreign films (e.g., ""la vie en rose"" amelie, sex and lucia, and water for chocolate), warm tropical weather, cold weather with a wood burning fireplace, cuddling in a thunderstorm, beaches, lakes, rivers, mangoes and dark juicy cherries, the smell of freshly cut grass, red hibiscus flowers because they remind me of home, laughing to tears at random stuff and times when i can say ""wow i've never thought of that"".  i don't like: burnt toast, shoddy restaurant service, narrow-minded ignorance, bland tasteless food, and superficiality.  i hate: cigarette smoke and mean, unhappy cynical people; both can lead to cancer.  truth be told, i do not yet live in san francisco. but that might be a good thing. we can get to know each other without all the pressure. i'll be coming to san francisco next month on the first leg of my 12-month dream trip adventure around the world. ask me if you want to know where i'm going.  in my life right now, i have decided to do a lot of the things i have always wanted. 2012 is a banner bucket list year for me. i have a great job that i love, and i can travel wherever i want because i work on the internet. ok get your mind out of the gutter; i don't actually make a living from my webcam strip showyet. i'm a biomedical editor. basically, i get to channel my inner nerd all day, and i can do it from anywhere on the planetwith a reliable internet connection...and a little electricity.  i am extremely curious and i love asking people questions they've never been asked before.  i love salvador dali's work and photographs by peter lik.  i am addicted to wikipedia and words with friends  i randomly do spontaneous things but i'm extremely goal oriented, focused and disciplined.  i usually don't like ice in my beverages.  i am capable of high levels of goofiness at times.  i use ""...."" way too much. in fact, now that i've gotten that off my chest, maybe i should start throwing them in now.  i like spicy food...and super-scrabble...not necessarily together. i think intelligence is very sexy. i love movies. i'm just a little eccentric (yeah just the right amount to keep people on their toes).  i'm great with my hands, i believe there is good in everyone, and i think adversity is a great teacher.  if you try to put me in a box.you will probably fail. that's actually true literally; i am very tall.  i'm a scorpio, so depending on who you are that's a good thing or a great thing.  so why san francisco? i spent a half day there christmas 2008 on an amazing whirlwind 2-week trip from nc to ca and backand i fell in love and vowed to return someday for a slightly longer stay (to confirm that it is the most amazing city ever and that i will be living there permanently...eventually). i have a couple of acquaintances in the bay area but no one i would seriously want to hang out with extensively or have as my unofficial tour guide. hint!! hint!!  why am i here?.......simply to connect with cool, interesting people that i might not meet otherwise.  however, if you are anything resembling flaky or superficial....please keep it moving.....i simply don't find that attractive and rather surround myself with people who have a little substance.  ___________________________________ thanks for reading and good luck with your search.  wow!! this was way longer than i planned. i blame the merlot.  ***** just a few of my observations on okc so far. 1) in general, i think contradictions can be intriguing but some simply are not..for example, i enjoy a night out on the town, but i'm also comfortable staying in. who doesnt!! 2) okc should filter out the people who have not been online in 3 months from the searches. it's quite useless for them to appear on the list. that's search results paddingopen and shut case. 3) most women who say they have a great sense of humor have absolutely nothing even remotely funny anywhere on their profile. what gives!! 4) pictures that are so small that they are squeezed up into the corner of the picture window should never be approved.","you know the little mechanism in cigarette lighters.....i go in there with my equipment and fix those.....lol.....seriously i do a lot but this isn't a job interview. i can read, write and calculate a 20% tip quickly.  seriously....i have a list of accomplishments, both academic and personal, to rival any. i graduated from medical school and i'm a biomedical editor helping scientists publish their work, which would hopefully help advance mankind's knowledge of the world. yeah...its that deep. lol.","getting to know people, listening, cooking delicious meals off the top of my head, massages, fixing pretty much anything (what can i say, its a gift), etc. etc. etc. this is a strange question.","my height my accent...wouldn't you like to know where its from..(apparently it's one of the 10 sexiest in the world, according to cnn).","books: i make time to read non-fiction more than fiction, although i have started reading fifty shades of gray...just had to see what all the hype was about;-). most recently read outliers by malcom gladwell, and isaacson's steve jobs. other favs include the alchemist and eleven minutes both by paulo coelho, uncommon genius by denise shekerjian, measure of man (sidney poitier's autobiography), business stripped bare (richard branson's autobiography). i wish i had more time to read for pleasure, but i do read for a living.  movies: way too many to name. avengers, hunger games, last year, i loved drive, crazy stupid love, and the help. other random ones that come to mind are gladiator, seven, bad boys ii, memento, definitely maybe, the hangover, the italian job, the bourne identity/supremacy/ultimatum, inception, state of play, good will hunting, the departed, the notebook, love in the time of cholera, elite squad, amelie, a constant gardner, kiss the girls, traitor, vicky christina barcelona, city of god and soooooo many more.  i'm also really, really into documentaries (touching the void, waiting for superman, waste land, the radiant child, the discovery atlas series, anything by national geographic and michael moore's documentaries)  tv: dexter, true blood, 30 rock, seinfeld, breaking bad, weeds, battlestar gallactica, californication, criminal minds, the ricky jervais show, real world, the buried life.",,ask me about this one cause it will take way too much time to type this up.,hmmmm!!! the possibilities are endless. ;-),maybe if you ask nicely.,you think this is the most intriguing profile that you've ever stumbled upon....in the last 20 mins  you have personality or can teach me something. (please....tell me something new)  you have a burning question you would like to ask me.  but most importantly....you want to.

nothing beats watching an entire series in one night until you've got episode references leaking out of your ears.  i'm perfectly aware that, outwardly, there isn't really all that much to me. there isn't really all that much 'interesting' to my life. i'm not 'outdoorsy' (which is apparently the kiss of death here in the bay area when it comes to meeting new people), i don't consider myself 'career-oriented' (though i can and do take pride in my work and love what i do), and i'm not into sports, not even watching them on tv.  it's inside my head where you have to go to find the really good stuff. it's a party in here, trust me. if you're looking for someone to do things with, look somewhere else, because i'm perfectly fine with just staying in and talking, thinking and dreaming all night. oh, and watching anime. lots and lots of anime.","i probably sound pretty boring to a lot of people - your standard otaku (minus the cosplay - i never touch the stuff) with no social life;

i have to look to light in order to exist here. either that or kill myself. there is no higher power to help me but myself.","-being a good human being. -argentine tango. -my two guitars, mandolin, and trumpet gathering dust in the corner. -my scuba gear gathering dust in the garage. -getting my snowboarding gear in tune since we have snow now.","mostly one of three things: 1. goin' out drinking, hanging with friends. 2. argentine tango 3. staying in, reading, watching a movie, bit of video gaming with friends online.","right, when i read out loud to myself i use a big dumb british accent. it helps me enunciate and slow down. i lived in london 1996-97, so it's totally cool.  also, having long hair is like having a second penis. you know, it has a mind of it's own, gets twisted up for no apparent reason so i have to beat it back in line, and gets in the way at inappropriate times. we can skip the times when i thought that lopping the whole lot off would be in the best interest of the world, but well, we have an understanding, so it's cool.  i wrote the above because i'm daft like that. i don't think it's that funny but maybe someone out there can appreciate it a little. my sense of humor leans heavily on the dry, subtle, morbid, cutting-edge near offensive side, fyi. incidentally, i just spilled hot breakfast soup all over the keyboard, always a winning maneuver in my book. it's cool.","-come over for a meal and we'll talk. i would like cooking for a new friend. or meeting at a nice, friendly bar for beer or mixed drinks is probably more appropriate for a first date situation. there's no end to excellent drinky places in the bay area.  -a woman with a bit of patience, since i'm socially inept in some ways. and i haven't seriously dated in a long ass time.  -you like to talk and you don't mind if i don't talk as much. :)"

there is nothing shocking about her song about cooking up a strawberry jam revolution. i like playing it while making jam on my electric stove. i've done that several years in a row.  i take great pride in my small carbon footprint. i quit flying many years ago. my lights have been cfl twisties for ages. i've been car free for more than five years. my power bill is generally around $20/month. i can go on and on about that type of thing.","i'm a local activist who works for a more sustainable system. you can find out much more about that from my website, tian.greens.org. if you go to public events in san jose or mountain view i'm likely to be at the green party table or working the crowd. i've spent a lot of my life single, so there isn't a lot of personal baggage in my background.  ummm... right now i'm gardening a lot. my tomatoes are green balls. my pumpkin is advancing across the patch. the collards are looking better every day. same with the eggplant. i just planted corn and cucumbers. artichoke season is mostly over. looking forward to harvesting grapes!","one thing i get good reviews on is taking pictures at bike party. another is my eggplant dip. people actually invite me to events and specifically request that i bring my eggplant dip. i'm okay about that during eggplant season, when i can stock up at the farmers market. the rest of the year i'm good at making bean dip.","...are the stickers on my bicycle. bicycling against oil wars is the biggest one. when i meet somebody else i'm likely to give them a one minute speech that boils down to ""don't waste energy"". i think using less fossil fuels is the key to solving so many problems. i'm not shy about finding another way to spread the idea around.","starting in my teenybopper years i read a book a day. i continued reading at least a few books a week until i got too busy with college to keep it up. i had more fun finding and reading heinlein books than any other. i was surprised years after i became a political activist to find out that heinlein was a populist political candidate before he became a science fiction author. i was surprised again when i found out by reading his political manual, take back your government that he knew grass roots politics. in that book i saw something similar to the activism style i'd figured out for myself organically. maybe heinlein was more of a teacher to me than i'd known.  i've not read much fiction in the past couple of decades. the best read i had last year was empire of the summer moon, a complete history of the comanche. i got it because when i picked it up in the bookstore my dad's hometown was right in the middle of the map of their range. once i started reading it i couldn't stop turning the pages. i love when an author does that to me. can't say i'm one of them, but i know a bit more about how the story ended then s. c. gwynne says in the book.  as a sustainability activist i've read a lot of books about oil and public policy. gore's inconvenient truth is just one of them, but that stands alone as the best cross marketing exercise, meaning both the book and movie were good and told the same story. i consider richard heinberg to be the best author in the genre. proof that his ideas scale well can be found in the titles of his books, ""the party's over"" and ""powerdown"". what does that tell you? his books expand on the theme in many ways. the best overview of the literature on the topic is rob hopkins book the transition handbook, how to transition from oil dependence to local resilience. that one has a lot more social science in it than most of them.  for music and movies i follow my mom's advice, which was ""bloom where you're planted."" my favorite bands are cake, sheryl crow, and michael franti and spearhead, but almost anything except very vulgar hip-hop will probably do. my attitude about movies is ""i'll see it if you'll go with me."" that is except for horror movies, which i avoid. i'm much more interested in talking about something else.","bed, bicycle, kitchen, enough public trust to enjoy talking to strangers, food and drink enough to get by, and the opportunity to do something else.",how to make our world more sustainable. how to meet somebody that can fit into my low carbon activist lifestyle. how tired i am of being single.,"riding my bike with bike party if that's possible. if it's the first friday of the month maybe i'm doing first friday in san jose. if you're single with nothing to do on the first friday of the month do that. maybe you won't meet me, but for sure you'll see many other single people. probably you'll have a good time, especially if you like art.","i'm allergic to cats. i had a girlfriend with a cat about a decade ago. i ended up allergic to my bed, allergic to the places she liked to sit, and generally miserable. my body rebelled. she was great in every other way, but i couldn't hack the breathing problems. no more. if you have a cat please go on to somebody else. turn the page. forget me.","what i really want is somebody to ride with in bike party rides. if you can keep a moderate pace for thirty miles or so on a bicycle on friday evening and enjoy it please contact me.  other than that, message me if i sound at all interesting to you. if i like your profile i'll probably invite you to have coffee with me or something like that in a public place. i'll even pick up the tab."

and maybe so. but i think we all need to find ourselves, before we have any hope of finding and knowing each other.  i'm a very passionate dancer. i dance all the time, when i get out of bed in the morning, at work when no ones watching, when i walk, when i'm alone in my room at night, when i'm out exploring or wandering, i dance. to me, for me, it's the purest and most raw form of self expression and emotion. there's no form or style to what i do, i just do whatever feels right at that moment.  i'm very love with, and in touch with nature. and this is the part i always have a hard time putting into words. i feel at home when i'm lying on back in a pile of leaves somewhere in the middle of a forest, or swimming in a river or the sea. when i drift off into day dreams, which is often, i dream of wandering through ancient forests, of south american islands, of rain forests and jungles.  i am dancing, dreaming, delving, discovering, disappearing.","finding out who i am, reading, dancing, singing, becoming more and more reclusive. trying to find like minded people, trying to resign myself that not many exist, and trying to find out what my next step is. i'm looking to move out the country, at least for a while, so i'm looking for something like an intentional community, or a farm i can live or work on.  oh, i also have a day job, but there's really not much to tell, except that it's soul numbing and i can't wait to leave it. though, i've met very interesting people through it, it's not an experience i'm sorry i've had, i think it's just about time for it to be over though.","well, dancing. there are very few things i think i'm truly and properly good at. dancing is the main one. i'm fairly good at some other things, singing, survival skills, knowing what plants are safe to eat. i'm also rather good at throwing a punch, and using daggers, i take really dorky anachronistic martial arts lessons.","perhaps the way i dress? i often look like i haven't noticed yet that the renaissance is over. i wear long dresses, always in natural tones, with either combat boots or these little leather purple ones that are always covered in mud. when people get closer, perhaps the way i walk, like i said, i dance. i also smile when there doesn't seem any reason to. i think it's ridiculous that people need a reason to smile. i think you should need a reason not to, and the fact that you don't seems reason enough that you do.","i am quite a bookworm. i have quite a passion for old fantasy, and some sci-fi, and just a touch of horror. i quite like h.p. lovecraft. my favorite author of all time is, and will always remain tolkien. his work is amazing, i tear up reading his descriptions of lothlorian and the ents. tom bombadil is my favorite of his characters though. i also am fond of lord dunsany, blackwood, and other old horror and fantasy authors. right now i'm reading asimov's ""foundation"", ""mistress of magic"", re-reading tolkien's ""two towers"", george r. r. martin's ""clash of kings"", which is more than a little dark for my tastes, but very good, unquestionably. on a very different note, i'm very political aware, so i read a lot of current-day politics and non-fiction books. i'm currently reading jeff sharlett's ""the family"", matt taibbi's ""griftopia"", and john perkin's ""confessions of an economic hit man"", amounst others.  i'm quite a music lover, and ecclectic doesn't do my music justice. i'm mostly a listener to folk-metal and just plain folk. i like beautiful, meaningful music, and lately i'm discovering a lot more. i love faun, blackmore's night, nightwish, within temptation, leaves eye's, amorphis, some abney park, october hill (if you know anything about them, skip this and move along to the send button), sirenia, tristania, delain, some flogging molly, a little pogues, and so much music i don't take at all seriously. i'm still known to occasionally put weird al on blast and sing along.","1. the moon -the moon has always had power in my life, and though i'm not superstitious, i am, in some ways, spiritual, and the moon has always been a source and focus of that. i do silly things like lying in my drive way in minus freezing temperatures to watch the moon. 2. the ocean -like the moon, i'm very deeply moved by the ocean, and will sit on the beach and watch the waves for hours. 3. nature -none of us can live without nature, without trees, without the earth, we forget too often that we cannot eat money. 4. music -music comes in different forms. all things form a rhythm. 5. my little ratties, or other animals in my life. -i know my rats won't be around forever, but i love them with all my heart. they're so sweet, there's something so utterly heart-melting about a rat sitting on your shoulder, testing to see if your ear might possibly be edibly. 6. the freedom from the need for material things. -i've come to a point in my life where i don't need /things/, though i do have some, i could get rid of them. beyond the basic necessities, food, cloths, shelter, i don't need to own things. i might be a little sad if i had to say goodbye to the stuffed puppy i've had since i was born though.","where i'm going, new story ideas, what i want to grow in my garden, what treats can i spoil my ratties with, a song. i almost always have a song running through my mind, which can be wonderful, and horrible. it can make finding quiet to think more difficult.  more abstractly though, i'm usually day dreaming. i'm usually thinking through a story, one i've already read, or one i'm writing. i love to write, and will compose in my head while i work, then go home and try to write it down, only to discover i've forgotten it all and kick myself. if you'd like to read something i wrote, i'd be happy to send you links, a warning, it's really not so good.","i like to think there is no typical. but i usually spend my fridays out waltzing in the southbay. it's a lot of fun, if you've ever wanted to try ballroom dancing in a fun, lively and casual setting, come check this place out.","that a lot is personal to me? i'm not an open book, i keep a lot of myself close to my chest.  but here's something i think says a great deal about me. i have ""forever will i wander"" tattooed on my left ankle in my own hand writing.  i am considering getting one other tattoo, but that one i'm much more reticent to talk about.","if you'd like to do any of the following platonically; -hiking -exploring -riding (yes, i have a motorcycle, it's all mine and i love it) -music listening -talking -dancing -if you have a wild and crazy idea and feel like sharing. i'm always open to new ideas.  i'm looking for friends, people to talk and share with. not a relationship. my stance on relationships is odd, too long and weird to put on a profile"

(2) internet. not only is it my lifeline to the world (mind you, i don't facebook stalk), but it just makes communicating/organizing with friends so much easier. plus, there can be a lot of useful information on the web.  (3) car. it just makes it so much easier to get around.  (4) instant ramen. i find myself eating ramen at least once a week. i know it's bad, and eventually it'll stop. it's just so easy!

(i love the spanish guitar.) my online radio dial is stuck on kcrw's eclectic24 music. i like drum circles. i've tried capoeira, salsa, and bhangra.  i don't follow sports, though i do occasionally care about the federer-nadal rivalry. i wish i could swim like michael phelps.  i am a news junkie. i like social commentary, both serious and of the daily show or colbert report variety, and i admire commentators who can hold up an honest mirror to society. i like art galleries and foreign movies. (i'm a fan of french and german cinema). but i don't go to these movies as much as i would like because my other more social activities like dancing often trump. perhaps you would like to give me company?  i'm a fan of opera, of louis prima, of david sedaris and jerry seinfeld.  i would describe myself as gregarious, optimistic, adventurous, spontaneous, and with a good sense of humor. i'm always up for learning something new and exciting, visiting a new place, and learning a new language. (i learnt german in school, lived in the netherlands so speak some dutch, and, in a pinch, can fake my way through french/spanish/italian.) i consider myself well-traveled.  i've lived in several different places, and the answer to ""where are you from?"" is getting longer and longer. :) i've lived and worked in india, europe, and various parts of the us. san francisco is by far my favorite place to live, though berlin and chicago can compete well on a good day. i'm eager for even more adventures and i can't wait for my next trip.  meyer-briggs says i am an enfp personality. i am on the cusp of libra and virgo, on the libra side. all of this means i happily acknowledge all the positive traits and deny each of the negative ones vehemently. :-d  i am fortunate to have a great job, fun and challenging, with absolutely wonderful colleagues, that makes me look forward to going back to work every day. i enjoy science, doing research, and learning math.  i'm looking to meet that special someone with whom to share all of this and more, and to grow with. are you a cheerful optimist like me? do you see the silver lining around every cloud? do you revel in adventure and novelty? if so, i would love to hear from you.  and just to prove that i'm not all work and no play, here's a video of me in a lindy hop dance performance, at work no less: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnw7fwc03we","i am enjoying being myself. this may sound clichd, but it's a very emphatic realization for me! as more and more aspects of my life click and come together, the more i realize how happy i am enjoying the present and looking forward to the future.  right now, i'm simply enjoying the novelty of a new and incredibly satisfying job, a new place to live, reconnecting with old friends, and looking forward to making new ones, including on okcupid! i have lived in several different places over the last decade and i'm looking forward to living in sf (which beats them all!) for a while.","making friends. i genuinely like meeting new people and many become long-lasting friendships, ""grapple[d] ... to [my] soul with hoops of steel"". :) (shakespeare, anyone?)  i would like to think i am a good listener.","my eyes, i'm told. i guess that's why i'm wearing sunglasses in my profile photo. ;-)","my tastes in books, movies, music, and food are all very eclectic. i'll pretty much try anything once. i just bought a kindle, so i'm returning to being a more avid reader and borrower of library books. :) but i think i should count as my favorites those that i come back to most often. so, here goes:  books: treasure island by r. l. stevenson (i think the idea of having such an amazing adventure at a young age must have really captured my imagination), the samurai's garden by gail tsukiyama, the pleasure of my company by steve martin, get shorty by elmore leonard, the spy who came in from the cold by john lecarre. believe it or not, i really like the james bond novels by ian fleming; try them, they are nothing like the movies! i also like reading nonfiction biographies and histories if one catches my eye, especially about world war ii. i admire people who can write good social commentary and make it funny, a la david sedaris and pu la deshpande. i have been known to read a math book for recreation, recently revisiting the cartoon guide to statistics. :) i like reading self-help books.  music: i enjoy all kinds of music. i'm usually listening to kcrw's eclectic music shows or pandora. kcrw music is hands-down the best music radio station out there and i love every single thing they play, which can be basically anything under the sun that is really really good. i like jazz, from ella fitzgerald to nellie mckay and from louis armstrong to paul anka and caetano veloso. i listen to indian classical music.  radio shows: i wonder if people still listen to the radio as much. well, i guess everybody listens to podcasts, like i do. my favorite shows are all on npr: wait wait, car talk, this american life, bbc's friday night comedy, and yes, apm marketplace. listen to kai ryssdal and bill radke make even gloomy financial news entertaining, the worse the markets the better is the background music!  movies: i like too many movies to list here. i really really like european cinema (subtitles and all), though i find most movies have something to enjoy. i don't watch as many movies as i would like to because i end up doing something else that feels more social and involves meeting other people. i wish there were a movie-going club. hmm ..  tv: i don't own a tv set, so i guess i should have more time for all the above! :) i watch some favorite shows on dvd, like seinfeld and frasier, and enjoy shows on pbs like the agatha christie mysteries. does anyone remember the inspector morse series?  food: san francisco has the best restaurants i've ever seen! i'm absolutely thrilled at the prospect of exploring each and every one of them. i appreciate good wine and beer and really enjoy chinese teas. i tried some nice sake recently, which was great!","my friends ... all six of them! :-d  seriously, my friends are important and really enrich my life.  other things that i would find hard to live without: - my radio programs (npr anyone?) - ways to stay in touch with friends (phone, internet, carrier pigeons ...) - quick access to restaurant recommendations - opportunities to travel and make new friends - the sun!  . . .  - internet access",what i should write in here! i'm new to meeting people online first.,"planning the weekend with friends. increasingly often, a long bike ride is definitely a part of my weekend plan.  actually, i haven't had a ""typical"" friday night. over the last few fridays, i have gone to the sf moma 75th anniversary party, assembled ikea furniture at home, gone to dinner with friends, gone to concerts at the independent and jazz at the masonic, worked late at the office, worked out at the gym, and been stuck in rush-hour traffic. so there. :)  an ideal friday night date would be going out for an intimate dinner or a little dancing and coming home to watch a movie, or just to have a meaningful conversation.","even though i claim not to watch or like tv, i can be convinced to stay in and watch an episode or two of my favorite shows. :) i am especially a sucker for old-timey shows (black-and-white and all). also, i kind of like big bang theory and i'm not afraid to admit it. i embrace my inner and outer science and math geek. :)  i wanted a pet goat as a kid (ha ha, pun intended). what (impractical) pet did *you* want?","- you are equally comfortable socializing, meeting new people, and staying in, enjoying a meaningful private conversation  - if you like watching tv one day and a foreign film the next  - reading a paperback detective novel one day and a history of wwii the next  - if you like going to the opera one day and dancing to a live gypsy band in the park the next  - in short, if your tastes are as eclectic as mine and if you love variety in everything"

(well, maybe new york, i love nyc). if my friends were to describe me, i think more than a few would classify me as laid back and easy going. i just like to have fun. despite my light hearted attitude, i still enjoy intellectual conversations and discussions ranging from topics on finance, politics, news, and yes, even religion (just never on the first date). i find it pretty attractive when a girl can go from talking about project runway to intelligently voicing her opinions on the current economic situation.  if i were to describe myself, i'd say i'm your typical ""guy's guy"" though. that is to say i love girls, sports, cars, and video games. that's not to be confused with ""watching sports all day long and playing video games all night long."" i also enjoy playing some old fashioned board and card games with my friends like settlers, apples to apples, and cranium. i actively participate in a softball league and am planning on signing up for more activities like flag football and dodgeball (if i can find a league). i'm a pretty competitive person. it's both a strength and a weakness.  now, when i said i was a ""guy's guy"", i should've said ""sort of"". you see, while i enjoy all the standard ""guy"" things, i have to admit a soft spot for... less manly things. for example, i like watching certain rom-coms. when harry met sally, how to lose a guy in 10 days, and definitely maybe are some of my favorite movies.

i talk softly until i can find a big stick, i feel comfortable with large crowds and small, old and young. i love to learn from them, about them, what makes them tick, and what will make them break.  above all, i'm never alone, but always lonely.  i am shrewd, humorous, and professional","in short, i am a translator, a teacher, a carpenter and a historian; an epeeist, an ultimate frisbee nut, a basketball guard and an avid outdoorsman; a traveler, an observer, a thinker and a dreamer... and a foremost advocate for the use of greek oratory tri-colons.  i don't know yet what i want out of this life. i have a vague sense that i want to be remembered by future generations, that my life should not be spent in a worthless struggle to be forgotten in the endless void of time. with each place i've been to, i have left a footprint, a ghost of my former self. i am interested in learning about all things and am an amateur student of human nature. i like to learn what makes humans and things tick, and what makes them break.  i am a teacher, both at the elementary level and the college level. whereas elementary students would wear their emotions, their likes and dislikes and their wants and needs on their sleeves, college students and adults can hide their yearnings a little better, but from their mannerisms, they are still, ultimately, the same. i would like to dedicate my life to creating a new system of education that embodies the best aspects of traditional chinese education: discipline, memorization and sheer quantity of a variety of knowledge; with key elements of american education: discussion, learning from teachers and students alike and practical application of learned knowledge. this is a distant dream, but i believe i can make it into a lifetime accomplishment that will certainly leave a mark for future generations.  i would also like to reacquaint people from our modern world with memorable episodes in chinese history. there are so many lessons and so many examples that would have served as guides to modern tacticians and politicians alike. i fear that modern politicians have a tendency to regard only science, technology and their own problems as having never been experienced in history before. and so, history is repeating itself. as a historian, i believe there is a great deal of wisdom lost and with the right venues, can be re-introduced into popular culture. this would also be a unique business to establish and maintain.","i am very articulate, at the risk of being verbose.  i have exceptional hearing, to the bane of all my students.  i have an unfailing memory, and am usually coined as an encyclopedia.  i am a good listener, though accused of being too logical.  i am a versatile translator, seemingly intolerant of language errors.  my ultimate frisbee throw bridges the entire field, causing my teammates to run like hell.  i am an enthusiastic teacher, still bothered by students who won't try.  i am a poignant and keen observer, dubbed for being a cynical skeptic.  i love to play literati on yahoo or scrabble, and memorized the dictionary for just this purpose.  i enjoy fencing epee, though i see that it is also elusive enough to escape my dictionary.  i absolutely love the transformers, to which i attribute many of my lifetime accomplishments.  i love the final fantasy series, though i haven't the time to play any more now.  now that i can afford all the consoles i liked as a kid, i no longer have any time to play them.  i love to write new role paying games (rpg) scenarios that incorporate elements of chinese and japanese history, and place more european and or magical/fantasy characters to see how they interact. this also gives me many ideas for writing short stories and novels.  i am a minor demon, posing in the human realm as an angel.  i am an expert in a card game called egyptian rat trap for i am fast at hand-eye coordination and memorize the card order, up to six decks, when i play.  i love to cruise in my car with all the windows down, though gasoline prices now hinder me from doing so.  i love to volunteer for community service, though i absolutely despise panhandlers and people asking for money.  i don't know if i believe in god, though i believe in destiny, fate, the mandate of heaven and most of all, in providence!  i am not religious, yet i say grace before my meals.  i have a passion for languages, though i am fluent in only two.  i love tales from ancient chinese history, though few people my age share this hobby.  i have taught college english for the past six years, though i still enjoy playing with legos in my spare time.  my professional resume looks great on paper - for i seldom find people my age with similar levels of expertise.  i am constantly surrounded by numerous friends, though none of them know me completely.  i am full of contradictions, but love the variety and possible adventure.","professionally: a big chinese translator/teacher/lecturer with a steeled countenance, an active personality and a professional, though humorous and personable attitude.  personally: big chinese guy with dark sense of humor and a seemingly endless resource of historical texts and quotations, a completely versatile taste in music, food and activities. if there were any stereotypes of what a chinese-american man would be, i have deliberately and unabashedly broken most of them: i don't drive a honda, accura nor toyota; i am not into the sciences; i don't speak english with an accent (except possibly texan english when i am really angry); i slam academics though i am one; i can last longer than most of my friends at endurance related sports; i can converse just as passionately about classical music as well as rap; i can recognize the subtleties in taste in wines, liqueurs and teas; i am inward well organized, and outwardly messy... for this latter point, i will take sherlock holmes as my defense, though i don't have a housekeeper nor a habit of practicing the revolver indoors.","books: sun zi (sun tze) - art of war, luo guanzhong - romance of the three kingdoms, the thirty-six strategies, leo tolstoy - war and peace, agatha christie - and then there were none (aka: ten little indians, originally published as an even more racially charged term).  movies:  japanese - tenpopo (dandelion), rashomon, kagemusha, ran  chinese - shaolin temple, iron monkey, to live,  french - amelie  english - glory, ferris bueller's day off, twelve angry men, the usual suspects, la confidential, fried green tomatoes, good morning vietnam  music: the preset channels in my car and five of my top cds should give a pretty good assessment of my taste in music.  1) classical 102.1 kdfc  2) wild 94.9, rap kyld  3) alice 97.3 modern rock  4) soft rock 96.5 koit  5) rap 106.3 kmel  6) national public radio, 88.5, mostly for news, fresh air and lake wobegon  7) star 92.3 anything goes  8) alternative 105.3  cd1 - chinese modern pop  cd2 - american show tunes  cd3 - a collection of japanimation tunes  cd4 - a list of top club songs from my djing days in nyc  cd5 - good driving music and other songs i can sing off-key to.  food: i am an epicure, i love to try out new and interesting foods, local delicacies and often go out of my way to try new things. i am an omnivore in the true sense of the word.",intelligent conversation! humor! an explorer/experimenter's soul! exercise! family and friends! fresh air (being in beijing for any period of time will make you appreciate this commodity more!),"education, history, bridging the social, language and cultural gap between the united states and mainland china.  men's inhumanity to other men, beginning and maintaining a clothing business, ways to help fledging history restoration bureaus throughout mainland china and ways to remedy the poverty and or homeless situation in american urban centers.","out clubbing, djing, bar hopping, dancing until i'm sore.  fencing, ballin', hiking, camping and playing 50 minutes of ultimate frisbee and forgetting the score.  visiting a museum, attending an exhibition opening or work.  playing video games online, on lan or on console, rpg, action and more.  translating, researching, calling business contacts in china or...  pondering over many a quaint and curious volumes of chinese lore,  tis this and nothing more.","nothing i would willingly admit that would not jeopardize the privacy of other people... so i will choose the fifth... and if you press on further, i may have to take the second.","interested in chatting about anything under the sun, going to see a movie, meeting someone new... or just looking to hang out."

(i mean, i'm assuming that no one is like, a die-hard michael bolton or kenny g fan, or something shitty like that. we all know the former's a ""no-talent ass-clown"" anyway!)  but here's a few that have really brought me joy, sadness, emotion, etc: - lauryn hill, aretha franklin, etta james, ""goodbye pork pie hat"" - charles mingus, bjork, radiohead, adele, michael jackson, nas - ""black president"", common - the light, kanye west, flight of the conchords!! - garcia marquez - 100 years of solitude, all the king's men - robert penn warren, tim o'brien - the things they carried, anything by david sedaris - derek walcott, adrienne rich, sylvia plath, e.e. cummings, neruda - the good wife, 24, heroes, 30 rock, buffy!!  ah, movies. i do love me some movies. there's nothing quite like that moment of darkness before a movie begins, and the theatre gets quiet. i've worked part-time in movie theatres (off and on) since i was 16 years old. i feel safe there, in the darkness, experiencing something with a room full of strangers. i feel like the crowd's energy matters, that it can contribute to the experience, unless of course the other patrons are being lame. so, i'll watch lots of different types of movies. some dramatic, sad, lovely favorites are:  all about my mother/todo sobre mi madre, frida, dirty pretty things, biutiful, magnolia (although seems kinda melodramatic now), and once.  the silly, awesome, ridiculous ones include: elf, clue, office space, nacho libre, role models (um, hilarious!!) and many more. i also really dig margaret cho. :)","-friends and family of course. life would be nothing without those we love. -pets (cats usually but i love most animals.) -my sense of humor, it's an asset in maintaining a positive mental attitude. -time alone to think and reflect -the beach, at least occasional access to it. -my grandpa's words of wisdom (they always seem relevant.) -music!

(bonus points!) you're open to listening to other viewpoints and still feel like you have something to learn from others, aka you don't have it all figured out yet, and that's a good thing. you have a good sense of humor. you don't say ""tits,"" or ""whores,"" unless there's a pretty good reason. at least not like, in everyday conversation. at least not very often. :)"

'was born; grew; shall pass on'; that statement may leave much out, but forms the skeleton whereon all else must hang, nor could anyone (except that he be possessed of too much self-regard) really assert that he, to be adequately captured, would need much more than our skeleton can say."": thus those subtler ones, who deserve esteem (not to grant as much would be to act the churl)---but perhaps also one must call them at least somewhat dour, when one looks at the skeleton they propose, so bare and joyless, but then one doubts there really beats a heart as abstracted from the human adventure as all that, to look on such a c.v. as at all adequate to anyone's course; at least, when one's thoughts are reflected back at oneself, and one muses on one's own ""self-summary"", the thought that more must be accounted for than those scant few facts cannot be escaped (and that, though one has one's share of dourness!); for example, any such account would have to say","and thereby make known (e.g.) one's employment (ass't. prof., on a short-term contract; one's duty as teacher: to follow the path of socrates, and corrupt the youth, present new gods to them so that they abandon the old, and generally prepare them for death---you know, the love of sophos), as well, perhaps, as one's plans for the future, what one does by way of a hobby or two, and whatever else gets ranged under that category, though one may be forced to confess that the aptest term to set the whole shape of one's present stage could just be ""flux"" (not, of course, that that means no more could be added on e.g. the ""hobby"" front, though one has to say one feels no great joy when called on to promote oneself, and chatter on, and generally say stuff such as ""oh, let me tell you, there's just so much that",", par exemple, banter, or should you want a well prepared so to speak ""adult beverage"", that can be taken care of, as can a cd of songs cleverly, even masterfully, arranged; the game taboo should be added to those others, as should wordplay, decadent cookery, and more; really, there's just no end to talents, when you've got me around""; no, one much prefers---because what follows demands less by way of lack of modesty---to speak of",", such as one's presence, one that commands deference from all others, yet does not gauchely obtrude, or one's ""natural"" (when one has one, and has not cropped one's 'do short), or for that matter one's","though because of the unusual procedure one has here adopted only some can actually be named (two-lane blacktop, sleuth, la genese, the sweet smell of success;

not to add that to lay down such rules smacks of an unseemly arrogance); however, these people apparently do not take proper account of the fact that the presence of such a sequence of statements about oneself really does not reveal all that much, at least not when the way one proceeds lacks style, and one therefore holds that those who say that a quantum of self-effacement both belongs properly to the genre ""personal ad"" and actually creates more chances for one's self to be expressed (perhaps because focus on the removal of even the smallest amount of bald, unsubtle statements that merely regard oneself equals more uncontrolled, even unknown to the author, chances for clues that tell much to escape through unguarded cracks and seams) are correct, and one has endeavored to make the present ad and that precept sound a consonant euphony together, to the extent that one produced the text you now read (when one may flatter oneself that any would read so much of such a daffy text!), and has sedulously not added the least jot of what one normally seem of utmost relevance, at least when one really does want to carry out the usual purpose of such an ad, except of course to adhere to the form, so that here one states what are",", namely, access to the oed, tools to use to cook, a computer that has decent speakers on, pals, a comfortable place to sleep, and books;

up with his family in vinh long province and stayed with his grandmother for about a year in the village. after he was around six years old, his family was given the opportunity to come to america because his father is a veteran of the vietnam war; he fought for south vietnam and, as a result, was forced to labor in various concentration camps for more than seven years after north vietnam, under communism rule, conquered the entire country. minh's family has been residing in san francisco, california since 1997; therefore, he have lived in the united states for about 12 years.  reflecting back, his mother said that giving birth to him was an extremely difficult process;minh was born one week late after the expected due date. his mother was in pain on and off for two days straight on top of six days of continuous stomach aches before he was finally delivered. by that time, her water bag had been almost completely dried. his mother breastfed him and gave him homemade baby food, such as blended vegetables and meat together. however, she told him that when he reached the age of about 2 years old, his main food choices were plain crackers and tofu. he would refuse to eat otherwise until he was around five years old.  minh grew up with his family all of his life, which makes him a very family-oriented person today. minh have two younger brothers named thoi and khai tran. dao the older sister is currently a junior in college, attending uc davis in medicine. thoi is a junior and khai is a sophomore both at thurgood marshall academic high school. his siblings and him are very close, he's deeply grateful for a supportive and loving family. he also have a half-brother and four half-sisters as well as an adopted sister. he have a large family because his father was married once before meeting his mother. however, his father's first wife passed away due to prolonged sickness, so his father met his mother after the war and they got married following the birth of the four of them.  minh has been involved in various concerts and live shows, because he's the founder of the au co dance company, au co teen youth group and au co production. it was founded nearly four years ago. the program is designed to help teenagers from all walks of life, to break out of their comfort zones and make a difference in society, even though, it's a vietnamese group. he welcome all people from diverse ethnicities & cultures. they express their teamwork by performing in dance shows throughout san francisco. their latest concert your passport to music & dance was at union square. his determination and drive to learn more and help others are increasing by the seconds.  during his journey in pursuing the arts, he encountered many obstacles. he comes from a family of ten siblings and his parents wanted their children to go into medicine or law. since he was not good at any of those things. he went against his parents' wishes and convinced them that he love what he do in visual and performing arts. his passion is embedded in this major, and he will continue to work hard in making that dream happen.","i am the founder of a music production, is currently in college. i do professional photography on the side.","graphic designs, new media, talking and communicating.","my smile, and my jokes. most of my friends say that i'm always making them laugh.","before i even start reviewing about this amazing movie that i just recently saw about two star crossed lover that finds true love at the most romantic spot on earth, i want to briefly share with you my experience and ask to see if you fit the storyline of this movie. it does sound sort of cheesy but, are you one of those single individual that usually stay at home and wrap yourself with a heavy thick blanket and watch your romantic life go by? are you a person that is utterly terrified of talking to that someone you've been having a mad crush for months or even years perhaps? well, if you fit these guidelines than you will absolutely love, love, love, this movie that i am about to review. since the movie is so long and there are so many great features that the director inserted in each of his scenes. i will not be able to cover it all. however, i want to target and share with you about the story line and how he use lighting and sounds to capture the true emotions that each of the characters play as star crossed lover.  are you ready for the name of this movie? okay, well here we go. the movie is call ""dear john."" its about ""u.s. soldier john tyree (channing tatum) falls for southern college student savannah (amanda seyfried), whose ideals and heartfelt principles are at once attractive and unfamiliar. but their love is put on hold when terrorist attacks prompt john to reenlist. now, handwritten letters hold the lovers together. lasse hallstrom directs this modern romance based on the novel by nicholas sparks.""  this modern day version of romeo and juliet is very heartfelt and sad. the beginning of this film is very happy and energetic. the director, lasse hallstrom did an amazing job by introducing each of the characters as their own story and uniting them at a beach party. the use of soft music or original sound track is very calming in this romantic comedy. he made us feel about what each of the two character went through before they met each other. the recently wounded solider john tyree played by channing tatum just completed his term in the military as he goes back to his hometown to visit his mentally sick father and then later meets the girl of his dreams.  when trying to provoke the audience emotions the director also try many external factors such as weather. i found that scene very powerful because it sends out messages that what ever john tyree played by channing tatum did as a young child, it will always come back to him in a form of rain drops. because, if we look deep in the symbolism of that one scene john tyree went through a lot as a child. his father suffered with a mental disability called autism and in his entire life as a high school student he was the bully and everyone feared him. he later entered the military and was wounded. the entire scene when he was with savannah (amanda seyfried), was at a newly build home that she volunteered at. but, the only thing that was built was the frame of the house. both lovers, hugged and kissed under the rain storm and it was very emotional because the director was trying to send out a message by saying that you should let your barriers down and try to let other people in your life in. that scene was a testimony of trusting other people.  my favorite quote from the film was when john and savannah had a conversation with each other about how other people fears john because he has such a terrifying background. john said ""why do you want to stay with me?, i'm a terrible person, i'm a trouble maker, i'm"" savannah said ""you don't scare me john."" then john respond with ""well, you scare me savannah."" that short and simple monologue between both of them really tells us that the director was trying to suggest that no one should judge each other by the way they look but by the way they act and feel.  as the film gets deeper into the climax, and the couple started to really fall in love, savannah had to leave with her parents to their home state and leave john and their vacation home merely as a bittersweet memory. it was hard for both of them to leave each other and this really took a toll on john. which sparked his interests again to reenlist. it was a hard time for all of them, john and savannah was now no longer spending time together every single day and the was terrorist attacking the united states. john didn't know what to do when he was in service.  as much as he tried to forget his one true love. he constantly wrote back to savannah overseas. they wrote for years, and that was his coping stress when he was fighting thousands of miles away. as time passed, john grew older and so did savannah. they both went their separate ways and she eventually married someone else. but, the most ironic thing was that she married a guy with autism. it was to honor john's father that had recently passed away. john sold his father's coin collections to pay for savannah's husband final hospital bills.  it was clear that they could not be together but they will always have those stacks of letters. the director did an amazing job by breaking each scenes and telling that story!  so, if your a hopeless romantic like me, then i totally suggest watching this modern day version of romeo and juliet.",1. friends & family 2. my iphone 3. my laptop 4. my teeth whitener 5. my money (should be #1 huh? ) 6. food & water,my career.,you can

(i really like forensic based dramas.) i also try to catch reruns of married with children (my one real guilty pleasure), and metal mania and rock 'n roll on vh-1 classic.  my favorite kind of music is 80's melodic metal: motley crue, scorpions, rainbow, van halen, ozzy, and so on. i also listen quite a bit to heavy metal in its christian incarnation (there are a surprisingly large number of christian metal cd's that i enjoy) but the base genre is metal.  as for food, my favorite eating out cuisines are chinese and italian although i haven't found much good chinese or italian where i live. i'm not the kind of person to blow $300 on a meal in san francisco so i haven't explored many of the restaurants there.","my son. my 17 year old boy, as frustrating as he can be, is the pride of my life and a joy to raise. i will miss him once he goes off to college and begins the transformation to becoming an adult.  the internet. i could never get the information that i want without it.  regular adult conversation. teaching 8th and 9th graders is very fulfilling, but it's hard to have an intelligent adult conversation with pubescent boys and girls.  crossword puzzles. i love puzzles of all types, and especially crossword puzzles.  music. for me, music makes life worth living.  my religious community. i currently attend a presbyterian church and it has been loving, supportive, and accepting of me for years. i'll never be without a religious community in my life.","how to become a better person and a better teacher. how to become a better guitar player. what i can do to provide an alternative role model for children who see thugism, gangsterism, and a life of crime as their highest aspirations.","either catching up on my grading, or spending time with my teenage son. raising him (or co-raising him with his mom) is my highest priority in life right now.","one of my ltgf's from my past once described me as 'oblivious,' and it's true. while i'm very analytical, i often find myself unable to process non-verbal cues accurately, and i equally often get such tunnel vision on a task that i completely tune out what is happening around me. thus, i am happiest being in a relationship when i am the submissive and not the dominant person, and someone who expects me to be able to figure out what is going on without any verbal context is likely to get extremely frustrated at times.","you are tall (5' 7"" or taller), hwp, long legs a plus, have a similar christian commitment, and are interested in a potential new friend. i'm pretty sure i want to get married again (i'm definitely not looking for a casual sex partner), but i plan to take things one step at a time. i am sure that i want to have female friends to do stuff with (movies, coffee, eating, exercising, and most of all talking). my ethnic preferences are for light skinned women, but i'm mostly interested in your character and life qualities and much less interested in your racial and ethnic background. smoking and any kind of drug use is a non-starter for me, but drinking in moderation (never to the point of inebriation) is ok."
